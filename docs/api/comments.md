# API Reference — Comments & Annotations

Comments attach threaded discussions to a document. Each comment is optionally anchored to a text selection range within the document content, enabling inline annotation workflows.

All routes require authentication. Read access to the parent document is required to view or post comments.

---

## Comment Tags

Comments support a `tag` to categorize their intent:

| Tag          | Purpose                           |
|--------------|-----------------------------------|
| `comment`    | General remark (default)          |
| `suggestion` | Proposed change                   |
| `question`   | Request for clarification         |
| `issue`      | Flags a problem                   |
| `note`       | Non-actionable informational note |

---

## Comment Status

Each comment has a `status` lifecycle:

| Status      | Meaning                                    |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `open`      | Active and visible (default)               |
| `resolved`  | Addressed — can be reopened                |
| `dismissed` | Closed without action                      |
